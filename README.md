Reaction game with external hardware via Velmann 167 input board and some simple games


This is a try to make a game where your reaction is tested.

The framework is build so new games can be added via simple classes.

External hardware:
- 3 buttons
- 3 lamps

In my test setup, the lamps are embeded in the buttons.
